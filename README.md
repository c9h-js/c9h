- 📁 **One library, many formats.** JSON, JSON5, INI, YAML, and TOML are all supported out-of-the-box as file formats!
- 💻 **Environment variables.** Handle environment variables as a source of configuration with no effort!
- 💯 **Zero configuration.** Cottonmouth works out-of-the-box using sensible defaults with no configuration required!
- 💪 **Typescript.** Fully typed and self-documenting.
- 🛠 **Extensible.** Bring your own file format parsers if we don't support your configuration files natively!

> **Cottonmouth is still in development, but most desired functionality is present and breaking changes are unlikely.**
